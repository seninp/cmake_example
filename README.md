A modified example of [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) module built with a CMake-based build system which is useful for C++ codebases that have an existing CMake project structure. 

This repo was created for [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47599162/pybind11-how-to-package-c-and-python-code-into-a-single-package) about *packaging* of C++ and Python sources into a single package.

Thanks!
